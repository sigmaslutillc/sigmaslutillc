Most traditional lenders require a bank account for loan approval. But you still may obtain access to a loan if you are willing to pay a higher price for the money.

Lenders want to take as much risk out of lending as possible. That is why they conduct credit checks, income verification, and even background checks before approving some applications. If a lender thinks you may not pay the loan back, they may reject your loan application.

Providing your bank account information is another way a lender can gain trust in your loan application. Your bank statement can show whether you pay your bills, receive a regular income, and keep a positive balance in your checking and savings account. In other words, it shows how responsible you are with money.

Nearly every online lender requires you to have an active checking account or savings account in your name because that is how they send you the money you borrow. The lender may also use that account to withdraw monthly or biweekly payments.

You’re going to have to walk into an office to find a cash loan if you don’t have a bank account. Local lenders are typically more permissive toward these types of loans because you have the ability to make payments in person, and, therefore, you won’t need to schedule online payments through a linked checking account.

Still, cash loans without a bank account add a layer of risk for lenders. As a result, they may charge a higher interest rate or add other fees to your loan to offset that risk.

Depending on how much money you need, a few cash loan options may not require a bank account for approval.
