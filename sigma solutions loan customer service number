Some local lenders provide a few different ways for you to receive your loan proceeds. If you apply in person, you can typically receive a check for your loan amount. Some lenders will pay out your loan amounts in cash, depending on how much you borrow.

The loan company may also deposit funds directly onto a prepaid debit card. These cards work like a checking account and debit card. You submit money to the cardâ€™s issuing bank, and the money stays in a secured account until you spend it by using your card.

Many lenders can initiate an electronic transfer from their bank account to your prepaid debit card account. In this case, you will typically receive your funds within an hour or so.

Not every private lender will offer this service. In some cases, you may have to pay a fee for the transfer.
